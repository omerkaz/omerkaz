## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ã–mer KAZ!  
  
### Glad to see you here!  
I grew up in the digital world and the internet helped shape me. I enjoy coding and have been self-taught. My goal is to become a successful Senior Front-End Developer and I strive to improve every day with the motto "NO ZERO DAYSðŸ’ª." I am curious about everything and always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
